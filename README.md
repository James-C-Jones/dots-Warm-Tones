===========================

Just a theme made from a color palette from a wallpaper. Enjoy.

===============================================================

**Dependencies**:

* Kitty *(alternatively I can provide color confs for any terminal if requested)

* Dunst

* Polybar

* Discord

* BetterDiscord

* betterlockscreen

* i3lock-fancy

* i3-gaps

* rofi

* picom-ibhagwan-git

**Other tools I use**:

* Sublime

* Spotify

* Thunar

* Zathura

* Neovim

## Boot 

I provided a grub theme (mostly just colors but hey its consistent with the theme)

If you're not comfortable changing this I wouldn't even bother. It's a bit of a hassle.

## Notes

I recommend going through and changing the "monitor: DP-2" or any variation of this and using "xrandr" to change to your monitor(s).   
I'm super OCD and like my rofi/dunst/polybar to spawn only on one of my monitors. I'm not sure everything you should look at but rofi/polybar/i3 are for sure you should look in the configs. 

I didn't bother saving any screenshots of the previous editon because it wasn't recieved very well.

## Enjoy
